# Raster tile index Tool
This tool creates raster tile (footprint) indexes. User inputs are the directory contatining the rasters/images (may contain sub-folders) and the Feature Class FC or Shapefile to which the raster extents will be added. The input FC must have a field called "location" that will hold the path to each raster tile.
